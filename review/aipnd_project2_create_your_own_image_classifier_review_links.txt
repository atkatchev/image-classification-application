1. A great blog on Object-Detection Object detection is more difficult task than image classification as you can have more than 1 object in the same image

2. A guide to Semantic Segmentation for predicting the object class for each pixel.

3. Tutorial for Image Captioning Image Captioning is an even more difficult task than object detection as it requires abstractive summarisation and natural language sequence generation.
